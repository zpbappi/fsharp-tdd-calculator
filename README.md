A simple calculator in TDD approach using F#

The whole codebase may seem a deliberate effort to make a simple thing overly complicated. 
However, my goal was to understand how to organize F# projects.

This repository is a result of series blog posts listed below:
1. [Part-1](http://zpbappi.com/simple-calculator-using-tdd-in-fsharp-part-1/),
creating the basic solution structure and creating a generic stack.
2. Part-2, 
creating the a calculator that operates on Reverse Polish Notation.
