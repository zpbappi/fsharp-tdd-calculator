# fsharp-tdd-calculator
A simple calculator in TDD approach using F#

The whole codebase may seem a deliberate effort to make a simple thing overly complicated. 
However, my goal was to understand how to organize F# projects.

This repository is a result of series blog posts listed below:

1. [Part-1](http://zpbappi.com/simple-calculator-using-tdd-in-fsharp-part-1/),
creating the basic solution structure and creating a generic stack.
2. [Part-2](http://zpbappi.com/simple-calculator-using-tdd-in-fsharp-part-2/), 
creating the a calculator that operates on Reverse Polish Notation.
Only managed to get two integer operands working in this part.
3. [Part-3](http://zpbappi.com/simple-calculator-using-tdd-in-fsharp-part-3/),
correcting the previous mistakes, updating the Rpn calculator to work with 
more than two operands of any kind (int or decimal) with any binary operator
known to the calculator.
